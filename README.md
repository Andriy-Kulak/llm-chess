# LLM vs LLM Chess

Install: `npm install`

Add your Perplexity API & OpenAI API keys to the `.env.local` file. Use the `.env.example` file as a template.

Run: `npm run dev`

## Purpose

I wanted to see how good LLMs are at playing chess against each other. Differerent versions of Claude vs Open Ai etc.
